# Introduction

Our application is made in the context of the course ARN (Apprentissage par
réseau de neurone) At the HEIG-VD.
Its goal is to classify different types of nuts.
In order to achieve this goal, we decided to take several pictures of cashew
nuts, hazelnuts, and almonds with various backgrounds, various specimens and various angles. We then completed our dataset with pictures coming from the web.
