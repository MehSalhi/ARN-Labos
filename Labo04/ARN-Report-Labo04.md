# Learning algorithm 

> 1. What is the learning algorithm being used to optimize the weights of the neural
networks? What are the parameters (arguments) being used by that algorithm? What
cost function is being used ? please, give the equation(s)

# Model Complexity

> 2. Model complexity: for each experiment (shallow network learning from raw data, shallow
network learning from features, CNN, and Fashion MNIST), select a neural network
topology and describe the inputs, indicate how many are they, and how many outputs.
Compute the number of weights of each model (e.g., how many weights between the
input and the hidden layer, how many weights between each pair of layers, biases, etc..)
and explain how do you get to the total number of weights.

# Deep Neural Networks

> 3. Do the deep neural networks have much more “capacity” (i.e., do they have more
weights?) than the shallow ones? explain with one example

# Tests

> 4. Test every notebook for at least three different meaningful cases (e.g., for the MLP
exploiting raw data, test different models varying the number of hidden neurons, for the
feature-based model, test pix_p_cell 4 and 7, and number of orientations or number of
hidden neurons, for the CNN, try different number of neurons in the feed-forward part)
describe the model and present the performance of the system (e.g., plot of the
evolution of the error, final evaluation scores and confusion matrices). Comment the
differences in results. Are there particular digits that are frequently confused?
